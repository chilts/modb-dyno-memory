# dyno-memory - An implementation of dyno-abstract for a memory store. #

```DynoMemory``` is a memory store implementation of [dyno-abstract](https://github.com/chilts/dyno-abstract/) which
is the cornerstone of an eventually consistent key/value store.

You shouldn't use this store in production, but you can use it for development or testing.

You can also use it as an example of a simple implementation of ```dyno-abstract```.
